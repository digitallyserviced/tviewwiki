## Why do my borders look weird?

See [issue #406](https://github.com/rivo/tview/issues/406) and [issue #281](https://github.com/rivo/tview/issues/281) for possible solutions. If none of them help, open an issue. Provide a screenshot along with your operating system and terminal application.

## Can I use the default colors of a terminal?

This is currently not possible. See [`tcell` issue 292](https://github.com/gdamore/tcell/issues/292) for more information.
